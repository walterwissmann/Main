## Modular Dock / Stand


You can use the mudular dock to store your tool head inside the printer 
or you can screw the dock to the stand to present or repair your tool head.

The adapter is the same in each case and only needs to be clicked in in the opposite direction.

There is also a holder for the shuttle so that the print head can be viewed freely from the front or to test the change system by hand.
