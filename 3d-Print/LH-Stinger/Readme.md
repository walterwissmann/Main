# LH-Stinger

The **LH-Stinger Tool Head** comes from the [LH-Stinger project](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger)

In my opinion, the LH-Stinger 3D printer is probably the most accurate and, as standard, the fastest 3D printer that you can currently build yourself.
Its print head is very stable and balanced, so I decided to adapt the LH-Stinger print head to the TapChanger. 
And it was worth it. The print results are also excellent here, so I far prefer this print head to the ones I have used so far.

  I would like to thank @LH once again for sharing his knowledge and passion for building an excellent 3D printer with us and for allowing us to use his findings and developments. 

Many thanks @LH.
